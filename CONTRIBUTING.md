## How to contribute
First, make sure that you carefully read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/hema-001/Daily-check-in-bot/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) of this project and you understand it clearly.
Then, You can contribute simply by following the standard Feature Branch Workflow [see this helpful tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) to understand how it works. 
**Note**: you may want to change the word "master" whenever encountered in the above tutorial with "main", since github changed the name of the parent repo from "master" to "main" recently.
